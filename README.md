# ðŸš€ Automated Construction Tender Management System  
### A Transparent & Automated Tendering Platform Powered by AI + Algorand Blockchain  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Public construction projects in India often face corruption, delays, cost overruns, and lack of transparency.  
This project proposes an Automated Tender Management System that combines AI/ML for estimation, Algorand Blockchain for transparency, and Smart Contracts for automation.  

Our goal is to create a transparent, tamper-proof, and citizen-accessible platform that ensures fair bidding, milestone-based payments, and long-term accountability.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement  
- Corruption and favoritism in tender allocation.  
- Lack of transparency in costs, materials, and timelines.  
- Manual payment releases cause delays and fraud.  
- Citizens cannot track real-time project progress.  

---

## âœ… Proposed Solution  
We solve this by integrating AI/ML + Algorand Blockchain + Smart Contracts:  

1. Tender Creation  
   - Govt uploads project details (budget, area, requirements).  
   - Data stored securely on Algorand Blockchain.  

2. AI/ML Estimation  
   - AI predicts material quantity, cost, time, quality benchmarks.  
   - Uses datasets + engineering formulas + past project records.  

3. Blockchain Storage (Algorand)  
   - Immutable, tamper-proof project records.  
   - Ensures auditability and transparency.  

4. Contractor Bidding  
   - Bids submitted by contractors are securely stored on Algorand.  
   - Prevents manipulation and favoritism.  

5. Smart Contract Deployment (Algorand)  
   - Automates payments, penalties, and milestone tracking.  
   - Handles exceptions like strikes or natural disasters.  

6. Verification & Monitoring  
   - Officials, citizens, and IoT oracles verify progress.  
   - Identities protected using Decentralized Identity (DID).  

7. Milestone Payments  
   - Smart Contracts auto-release funds when conditions are met.  
   - Penalties applied for non-compliance.  

8. Public Dashboard  
   - Citizens track projects by location, pincode, or project name.  
   - Shows real-time cost, progress, contractor info, maintenance cycles.

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack  
- AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn  
- Blockchain: Algorand Blockchain  
- Smart Contracts: TEAL (Transaction Execution Approval Language)  
- Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask/FastAPI)  
- Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- Frontend: React.js / Next.js with TailwindCSS  
- Hosting: AWS / Google Cloud / Vercel  
- Security: JWT, OAuth, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, DID  

---

## âš¡ Why Algorand?  
- Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS): Fast, eco-friendly, and scalable.  
- Smart Contracts in TEAL: Ideal for milestone-based automated payments.  
- Low Transaction Fees: Makes it cost-effective for government-scale systems.  
- High Throughput: Capable of handling thousands of transactions per second.  
- Green Blockchain: Carbon-negative, supports sustainable infrastructure.
